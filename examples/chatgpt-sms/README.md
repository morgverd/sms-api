# ChatGPT SMS

An example HTTP webhook server that receives incoming SMS messages via webhook and sends a reply generated by ChatGPT.

## Features
- Includes a per number message history of `20` (editable in source).
- Queues incoming messages to preserve response order.
- Message history can be cleared by sending a message with only `#`

## Running

The following environment variables must be set:

- `OPENAI_KEY` - ChatGPT API key.
- `SMS_SEND_URL` - Full URL to SMS-API send, eg: `http://127.0.0.1:3000/sms/send` 

> This is just an example, so it does not include proper authorization in the form of verifying webhook request headers etc.
> If this is actually used, consider using a proxy.

## Webhook Config

Example webhook config that would be added to the SMS-API main `config.yaml` file.

```toml
[[webhooks]]
url = "http://127.0.0.1:3001/webhook"
events = ["incoming"]
```
