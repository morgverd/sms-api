[database]
# [REQUIRED] An absolute path to the SQLite database that is used to store messages.

# [OPTIONAL] Modem Configuration.
[modem]
# The modem serial device path.
device = "/dev/ttyS0"

# The baud rate to use when creating device connection.
baud = 115200

# Buffer size for Modem command sender channel. This is bound to ensure that slow command responses don't result in
# unexpected backpressure as we keep adding new commands to the queue. If the queue is full, API requests are rejected.

# larger values will improve throughput by reading more data per system call however it uses more memory.

# [OPTIONAL] HTTP Server Configuration.
[http]
# If the HTTP server should be started. By default, this is false. Without the HTTP server, this effectively just
# becomes an SMS reciever which can use the webhooks to forward them since the HTTP API is required for sending.
# There should also be an SMS_API_HTTP_TOKEN environment variable set to authenticate HTTP requests.

# Should the SMS Send route only accept international number formats (eg: +44....)?
# This prevents sending to internal carrier numbers which could be used to check balance etc.

# This determines if a missing SMS_API_HTTP_TOKEN should trigger a panic.
# If disabled, the environment variable becomes optional.

# [OPTIONAL] Sentry error tracking and monitoring (requires sentry feature to be enabled)
[sentry]
# [REQUIRED] Your Sentry project DSN URL - get this from your Sentry project settings.

# Webhook Configuration Examples.
# You can define multiple webhooks with different configurations.

# Example 1: Basic webhook (receives only "Incoming" events).
[[webhooks]]

# Example 2: Webhook with custom headers (for authentication).
[[webhooks]]

# Example 3: Webhook with specific event filtering.
